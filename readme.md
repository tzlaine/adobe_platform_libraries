From the forked stlab repo:

Adobe Platform Libraries
=====

This started out as a fork from Adobe's original ASL Perforce server, but has since been undergoing development. Please contact the project owners if you have any questions or comments.

If you're trying to build this without the Adobe Source Libraries, you're going to have a bad time.

About this repo:

This fork was made to adapt the Adobe Platform Libraries to use in Unreal Engine 4 UMG UIs.  The Windows and Mac implementations have been removed.
